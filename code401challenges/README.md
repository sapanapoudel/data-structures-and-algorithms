### 1. Reverse the Array
    
#### Challenge
Write a function that takes an array as argument and return an array with elements in reverse order. 

#### Approach & Efficiency
To get the reverse array, I took two approaches. First, I didn't create the new array, instead I reverse the original array by doing swapping. My element was swapped to last element and second element was swapped to second last. In my second solution, I created a new array and all the elements in given array were placed reversely in new array. The Big O for this approach is linear time complexity since more numbers of elements in array takes more steps to iterate through the array. 
O(n) = Linear time complexity

### 2. Insert and shift an array in middle at index
  
#### Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes two parameters arr and the valued to be added. 

#### Source
Pair programmed with Merisha
  
#### Approach & Efficiency 
To insert the value at the middle of the array, I find the mid point. If my index at new array is less than mid point, i copied same element from output array to new array. If the index at new array is midpoint, then I insert the value. If index is greater then midpoint, it copied element from input array at index - 1. Both time and space complexity is O(n).

### 3. Binary Search 
  
#### Challenge
Write a method called BinarySearch which takes two parameters sorted array and search key and return the index of the key of found. Return -1 when  not found.

#### Source

#### Approach & Efficiency
1. Array must be sorted
2. Find the mid point of the array and compares it against search key
3. If element at mid index is equal to search key, return mid index
4. If the element is greater than search key, search the left half of the array
5. If the element is less than the search key, search the right half of the array
6. If not found return -1

### 4. Linked List
#### Challange 
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created. 

#### Method
```
insert()
include()
toString()
```

### 5.Linked Class
#### Challenge
Create a methods which add new node with given value at the end of the linked list. Also create methods called addAfter and addBefore.

#### Approach and Efficiency
1. Given the value, create a new node and add at the end of the LL
2. Locate current node
3. Attach new node to end
2. Create an adaBefore method 
3. Create an addAfter method

#### 6. k-th value from the end of a linked list.
#### Challenge 
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

#### Source

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/
#### Approach and Efficiency 
1. Use two pointers; current and main and initialize both at head
2. First move current pointer to kth element from head
3. Now move both pointers one by one until main pointer reach to the end
4. Now the main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return the main pointer.

## 7: Merge two linked lists.
#### Challenge 
Write a method that takes two linked lists as parameters, merge them together and return reference to the head of single merged linked list.

#### Approach and Efficiency
1. Use two pointers both reference to the head of first node, but move only one while another one always point to the haed of first list.
2. If the first list is empty, return second one, if second one is empty, return first one.
3. While both are not empty, When current first is moved to current second, move one pointer the current second also
4. When moving  pointer hit the null, return another pointer referencing to head of first list. 

Time Complexity = O(n)
Space Complexity = O(1)

## 8: Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure
#### Challenge 
Create node, stack and queue classes and implement top, push, pop, peek, front, enqueue, dequeue, and peek methods.

#### Approach and Efficiency
1. Create a Node class with value and next node
2. Create Stack class that defines methods called push, pop, and peek
3. Create Queue class that defines methods called Enqueue, Dequeue, and peek

Time complexities of all these methods are O(1)

## 9: Implement a Queue using two Stacks
#### Challenge 
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects

#### Approach and Efficiency 
1. Create a method that takes 2 stacks as parameters 
2. Create enqueue method to push value in one stack1
3. Create dequeue method to pop value from stack2

Time complexity: for Enqueue is O(1)
Time complexity: for Dequeue is O(n)
